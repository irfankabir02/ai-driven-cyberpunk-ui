# Claude Prompt Framework for Optimized ChatGPT Workflow Integration

## Objective:
Create Claude-generated artifacts (e.g., diagrams, dashboards, structured outputs) that enhance ChatGPT‚Äôs execution workflow by making problem-solving more efficient, structured, and actionable.

---

## General Prompt Structure:
**‚ÄúClaude, I need an enhanced artifact that maximizes ChatGPT‚Äôs ability to process, refine, and execute tasks efficiently. Here‚Äôs the context and the expected format:‚Äù**

### Key Components:

1. **Contextual Background**
   - Clearly define the problem, workflow, or analysis needed.
   - Specify **why ChatGPT needs this artifact** (e.g., to enhance structured execution, debugging, optimization).
   - Provide **relevant constraints** (e.g., computational limits, structured breakdowns).

2. **Desired Output Format (Artifact Type)**
   - **Diagram:** Process flowcharts, system architectures, dependency mappings.
   - **Dashboard/Table:** Structured insights, analytics breakdown, component comparisons.
   - **Framework/Checklist:** Step-by-step execution plans, structured debugging guides.
   - **Visual Summaries:** Conceptual explanations for complex technical topics.

3. **Optimization Parameters**
   - Ensure **modular structure** for ease of refinement by ChatGPT.
   - Include **data-driven components** where applicable (tables, KPIs, benchmarks).
   - **Highlight dependencies** and bottlenecks in execution workflows.

4. **ChatGPT Integration Strategy**
   - Define **how ChatGPT should use the artifact** (e.g., extract sub-components, refine execution, perform iterative improvements).
   - If applicable, **align with specific ChatGPT capabilities** (e.g., code generation, process optimization, multi-step execution).

## Example Prompts:

### **1. Debugging Workflow Optimization**
**‚ÄúClaude, generate a structured flowchart that outlines the debugging workflow for a slow Python script. It should include:**
   - **Root cause analysis paths** (e.g., I/O bottlenecks, inefficient loops, memory overuse).
   - **Decision points** on optimization approaches (vectorization, multiprocessing, caching).
   - **Feedback loops** that allow iterative refinement in ChatGPT.‚Äù**

üëâ *ChatGPT will use this to generate optimized debugging scripts and test different performance improvements efficiently.*  

---

### **2. AI Execution Strategy for a Machine Learning Model**
**‚ÄúClaude, create a performance optimization dashboard for training a deep learning model under hardware constraints. Include:**
   - **Training bottleneck identification (CPU, RAM, GPU, disk I/O).**
   - **Recommended strategies based on available resources (gradient checkpointing, mixed precision, distributed training).**
   - **Decision-tree flowchart** for selecting the best optimization method.‚Äù**

üëâ *ChatGPT will use this to refine and implement system-aware execution plans dynamically.*  

---

### **3. Step-by-Step Task Breakdown for a Complex Workflow**
**‚ÄúClaude, generate a structured execution framework for a multi-step ETL data pipeline. The output should include:**
   - **Stages of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) with key dependencies.**
   - **Potential failure points and resolution strategies.**
   - **Performance tuning recommendations at each step.‚Äù**

üëâ *ChatGPT will use this to implement optimized ETL strategies and improve automation scripts.*  

---

## Final Optimization Rule:
üí° **Every Claude-generated artifact should be designed for modular use in ChatGPT**, allowing for:
‚úÖ **Step-by-step refinement**
‚úÖ **Integration into structured execution workflows**
‚úÖ **Automated enhancement of problem-solving**
