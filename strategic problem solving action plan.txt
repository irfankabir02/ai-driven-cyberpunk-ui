I'll help you create a structured plan for your tasks (2, 4, 6, 7) using your Windows 10 Dell all-in-one PC setup along with Claude, ChatGPT Plus, and Grok 3 Beta.
Let me first analyze what tools we have and what their strengths are:
Your Hardware Setup:

Windows 10 Dell all-in-one PC
No dedicated GPU
Limited CPU power
Windows Terminal
Python installed

AI Assistants:

Claude (visual interactive artifacts capability)
ChatGPT Plus (no visual artifacts but strong coding capability)
Grok 3 Beta (newer capabilities)

Let's create a structured plan for approaching your tasks:

Since you're working with a Windows 10 PC with limited resources, let's set up an optimal local environment for running your code. I'll create a visualization of how your environment can be configured:Python Execution Environment SetupClick to open componentTap to open4. Task-Specific Tool Allocation
Now let's create a specific plan for how to distribute your tasks (2, 4, 6, 7) across the available tools:Task Distribution Across AI ToolsClick to open diagramTap to open5. Performance Optimization for Limited Hardware

Now that I've created visual artifacts to help guide your approach, let's outline a concrete step-by-step plan for implementing your tasks using the tools available:

Initial Planning Phase

Define specific requirements for each task (2, 4, 6, 7)
Use Claude to create visual flowcharts and diagrams of the overall structure
Break each task into smaller sub-tasks


Environment Setup

Create a dedicated virtual environment for each task to isolate dependencies
Install only the necessary packages to minimize resource usage
Consider lightweight alternatives to heavy libraries


Implementation Strategy

Task 2:

Use Claude for visual explanations and code architecture diagrams
Implement core algorithms with ChatGPT's help
Test on small datasets first before scaling


Task 4:

Use Claude for interactive demonstrations and visualizations
Get alternative implementation ideas from Grok 3 Beta
Optimize for your hardware limitations


Task 6:

Use Claude for visual components and interface design
Develop core algorithms with ChatGPT Plus
Implement processing in chunks to manage memory


Task 7:

Create interactive prototype with Claude
Get performance optimization suggestions from Grok
Test thoroughly with various inputs




Optimization Phase

Profile each implementation to identify bottlenecks
Apply the optimization strategies from the Performance Optimization artifact
Test optimized versions against original implementations


Documentation & Finalization

Document code extensively with clear examples
Create visual guides for using each implementation
Provide clear instructions for running on limited hardware



This structured approach leverages the strengths of each AI tool while accounting for your hardware limitations. Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any specific part of this plan or if you need help with implementing any of these tasks!
