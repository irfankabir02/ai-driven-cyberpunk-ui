Edit
I notice you've shared a Python class called ProblemDissectionFramework. This appears to be a structured approach for breaking down and analyzing problems through a series of guided steps. Let me walk you through what this code does and how it works.

The ProblemDissectionFramework class creates a systematic way to tackle problems through six distinct steps, from clarification to testing and refinement. The code collects user input at each step and stores these responses for review at the end.

Think of this framework as a dark castle with six chambers, each room designed to extract a different essence from the problem you seek to understand. Like an alchemist's laboratory where raw materials are transmuted into clarity:

The first chamber asks you to name your adversary clearly - defining the problem
The second has you gather arcane knowledge about this foe - research
The third reveals the hidden components and unknown variables
The fourth helps discern which elements hold true power - relevance
The fifth allows you to craft your strategic ritual - prioritization and planning
The final chamber is where you test your crafted solution and refine it through feedback
When executed, this framework guides you through each chamber in sequence, collecting your thoughts and insights, before presenting them all together at the end of your journey.

I notice there's a stray letter "t" at the end of your code that doesn't belong there - removing this would make your code run properly.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this code in more detail? Or would you prefer to see how to use this framework with a practical example?
